<p> Padua Academy offer a variety of different sports at all times of the year. One thing to remember as a freshman is although you might want to tryout for every sport and do everything, doesn't mean it's a good idea. Freshman year is one of the hardest because, while it is great to be involved in sports, school work should always come first. Even if you've always done a lot of sports in grade school/middle school, it gets even harder to juggle both sports and academics once you get to highschool.</p>
