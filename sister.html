<h3>Big Sister, Little Sister Hours</h3>
<p><strong>At the beginning of freshmen year, you are assigned a senior for your Padua Big Sister. They are your guide and aid throughout your first year. You can always ask them questions, and you get to participate in fun activities with them - like service hours!</p></strong>
<br>
<b> Together, the two of you will complete 3 hours. Your big sister will most likely contact you to get together, but if she does not, feel free to reach out to her! The two of you can get hours in any way of your <a href="file:///Users/allisonstuebing/Desktop/Web%20Page%20Design/How%20to%20Survive%20Freshmen%20Year/places.html">choice</a>. After you finish your hours by mid February, there is a meeting at flex to reflect on what the two of you did. The meeting will last most of flex, and you will share where and when you volunteered. There will also be a short video.
